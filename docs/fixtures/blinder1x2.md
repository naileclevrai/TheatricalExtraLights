### Channel by channel

**1 · Intensity** — Master dimmer. 0 is dark, 255 is full output. The beam, the projected spot and the dynamic light in the room all scale with it. Fades are smooth: the client interpolates between DMX frames.

**2 · Red** — Red component of the additive colour mix.

**3 · Green** — Green component of the additive colour mix.

**4 · Blue** — Blue component of the additive colour mix. With red and green at 255 too the light is white; all three at 0 gives a dark fixture even with the dimmer up.

**5 · Strobe** — Mechanical shutter. 0 is closed (dark regardless of the dimmer), 1 to 254 strobes from slow to fast, 255 is open. Use 255 for normal operation and drop to 0 for a hard blackout that keeps the dimmer level.
