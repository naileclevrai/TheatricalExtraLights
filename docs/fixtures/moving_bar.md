# Moving Bar

`theatricalextralights:moving_bar` · family: [Moving heads & beams](/fixtures/moving-heads)

Tilting LED bar with eight pixels and a wash texture.

- Hangs from a truss or stands on the floor; hung upside down, pan and tilt are mirrored automatically.
- Right-click opens the config screen; pan and tilt are DMX-driven, so there are no position sliders.

## Personalities

| Mode | Channels |
|---|---|
| 7-Channel Mode | 7 |

Select the mode in the fixture config screen; the footprint changes immediately.

## 7-Channel Mode (7 ch)

| Ch | Function | Values |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Intensity | 0 off to 255 full |
| 2 | Red | 0 to 255 |
| 3 | Green | 0 to 255 |
| 4 | Blue | 0 to 255 |
| 5 | Focus | 0 tight to 255 wide |
| 6 | Pan | 0 to 255 = −180° to 180° |
| 7 | Tilt | 0 to 255 = −225° to 45° |

### Channel by channel

**1 · Intensity** — Master dimmer. 0 is dark, 255 is full output. The beam, the projected spot and the dynamic light in the room all scale with it. Fades are smooth: the client interpolates between DMX frames.

**2 · Red** — Red component of the additive colour mix.

**3 · Green** — Green component of the additive colour mix.

**4 · Blue** — Blue component of the additive colour mix. With red and green at 255 too the light is white; all three at 0 gives a dark fixture even with the dimmer up.

**5 · Focus** — Cone width of the beam. Low values give a tight pencil beam, high values a wide wash. It also drives the size of the light spot on the ground.

**6 · Pan** — Horizontal rotation of the head. 128 is straight ahead relative to the block's facing; the full range is one turn (−180° to 180°). Moves are interpolated between frames so slow fades look smooth.

**7 · Tilt** — Vertical rotation of the head, −225° to 45°. Around 212 the head points straight along its own axis (0°); lower values tilt it forward and down, all the way over the back. Hung upside down the range is mirrored automatically.

## 34-Channel Pixel Mode (Pan, Tilt + 8x Dim/RGB) (34 ch)

Pixels are numbered 1 to 8 from left to right, seen from the front of the head. Each pixel lights its cell, its LED dot and a flat beam of its own colour; neighbouring pixels of the same colour share one volumetric sheet. There is no master dimmer: to fade the whole bar, select the fixture and use its dimmer. A ready-made [grandMA2 fixture file](/guide/grandma2) exists for this mode, with the pixels as sub-fixtures 1.1 to 1.8. Pan and tilt sit on the main fixture, channels 1 and 2, with the same ranges as the 7-Channel Mode; there is no focus channel.

| Ch | Function | Values |

**6 · Pixel 1 blue** — Blue of pixel 1.

**7 · Pixel 2 dimmer** — Dimmer of pixel 2. 0 turns the pixel off whatever its colour. There is no master dimmer in this mode; the dynamic light in the room follows the brightest pixel.

**9 · Pixel 2 green** — Green of pixel 2.

**10 · Pixel 2 blue** — Blue of pixel 2.

**21 · Pixel 5 green** — Green of pixel 5.

**22 · Pixel 5 blue** — Blue of pixel 5.

**23 · Pixel 6 dimmer** — Dimmer of pixel 6. 0 turns the pixel off whatever its colour. There is no master dimmer in this mode; the dynamic light in the room follows the brightest pixel.

**25 · Pixel 6 green** — Green of pixel 6.

**26 · Pixel 6 blue** — Blue of pixel 6.
