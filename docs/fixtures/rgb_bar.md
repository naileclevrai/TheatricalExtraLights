## 4-Channel Mode (4 ch)

| Ch | Function | Values |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Intensity | 0 off to 255 full |
| 2 | Red | 0 to 255 |
| 3 | Green | 0 to 255 |
| 4 | Blue | 0 to 255 |

### Channel by channel

**1 · Intensity** — Master dimmer. 0 is dark, 255 is full output. The beam, the projected spot and the dynamic light in the room all scale with it. Fades are smooth: the client interpolates between DMX frames.

**2 · Red** — Red component of the additive colour mix.

**3 · Green** — Green component of the additive colour mix.

**4 · Blue** — Blue component of the additive colour mix. With red and green at 255 too the light is white; all three at 0 gives a dark fixture even with the dimmer up.

## 36-Channel Pixel Mode (9x Dim/RGB) (36 ch)

Pixels are numbered 1 to 9 from left to right, seen from the front of the bar. Each pixel lights its cell, its LED dot and a flat beam of its own colour; neighbouring pixels of the same colour share one volumetric sheet. A ready-made [grandMA2 fixture file](/guide/grandma2) exists for this mode, with the pixels as sub-fixtures 1.1 to 1.9.
